This project is meant to serve us, programmers, with solution to every day problems,
just like Batmans Utility Belt does for him.
Our goal is to regulary add solutions that might be neccesery for me or for others in some situations,
or just things that are intersting to code.
We will relay **only** on open-source libraries
This project will include anything from basic sorting algorithms, to specific frame work features.

## Programming Languages
We start with Java as it is our native language.
In the future we would like to add solutions in :
- JavaScript
- TypeScript

our goal is to have as much solutions and as much programming languages and technologies as possible

## WE WANT YOU !!!
We want this to become collaborative project, so anyone who would like to contribute,
please contact me to the email : orr.bob@hotmail.com
